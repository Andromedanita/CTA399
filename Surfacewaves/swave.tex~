\begin{abstract}
We show that surface waves along aligned interstellar current sheets
lead to pulsar scintillation properties consistent with those
observed.  In this picture, the interstellar medium is quiescent, with
scintillation and scattering resulting from weak waves propagating
along magnetic domain boundaries, which are expected from helicity
conservation.  This model quantitatively predicts the spacing and
amplitudes of inverted parabolic arcs.

\section{Introduction}

The structure of the interstellar medium has remained enigmatic. Five
decades of pulsar scintillation observations\cite{1968Natur.218..920S}
have resulted in problematic physical requirements.  Current
observations have demonstrated that much of the scattering is
dominated by a small number of very localized lensing
screens\citep{2010ApJ...708..232B}.  With the lensing screen, the
scattering is in turn dominated by spatially localized structures.
This is inconsistent with random diffractive processes in an extended
turbulent medium.

\section{Two Regimes of Lensing: Diffractive vs Refractive}

Two regimes to generate pulsar scintillation have been considered. In
the diffractive picture, the lensing angle is determined by the size
of structure in the medium, compared to the wavelength $\lambda$:
$\theta=2\pi\lambda k$.  The amplitude of each scattered structure is
determined by the depth of the modulation.  To explain the observed
angles in the range $1-100$ mas at wavelength $\sim 1$m, requires
structures in the ISM on scales of order $10^{6-8}$m. This might seem
surprising, since it is much smaller than the coloumb mean free path
of free electrons in the interstellar medium.

A second mechanism is due to refractive lensing.  In this scenario,
the bending angle is determined by Snell's law, i.e. the change in
refractive index and the angles of incidence.  The flux of the images
is determined by the size of the lens over the impact parameter.

\cite{2006ApJ...640L.159G} showed that refractive lensing results in
scintillation similar to the diffractive picture.  In this refractive
lensing, localized refractive images act like a multiple slit
interferometer. The beating of these images results in the rapid
frequency and time variability, and has scalings very similar to the
purely diffractive picture. 

The discovery of parabolic arcs\citep{2001ApJ...549L..97S} and
inverted arclets has required the existence of localized refractive
lenses.  Direct VLBI imaging of the scattering
screen\citep{2010ApJ...708..232B} demonstrate the presence of
discrete isolated lenses, i.e. scattering points, which are all in a
single thin sheet. This leads to physical challenges of confining
these lenses. Various solutions have been
proposed\citep{2007ASPC..365..299W,2012MNRAS.421L.132P,2006ApJ...640L.159G}.




\section{Astrophysical Picture}

The interstellar medium is stirred on scales of parsecs by various
energetic processes, including supernovae, ionization fronts, spiral
density waves, and other phenomena.  These processes are generally
short lived, and after the stirring, the warm medium relaxes to an
equilibrium configuration.  In the presence of helicity, the
equilibrium magnetic fields are configured as interlaced twisted tori,
which are long lived\citep{2004Natur.431..819B}.  The magnetic fields
are locally almost parallel, with discontinuous interface regions, a
bit like magnetic domains in a ferromagnetp\cite{2009arXiv0909.1815G}.

At the boundary between between magnetic field configurations, current
sheets maintain the discontinuities.  These current sheets have been
proposed to dominate the scattering of radio
sources\citep{2006ApJ...640L.159G}.  

\section{Surface Dynamics}

The current sheet is physically thin, $< \sim $ AU.  On each side the
magnetic field points in a different direction.  The change in alvenic
properties gives rise to surface
wave\citep{1991SoPh..133..263J,2009GApFD.103...89J}, which are
analogous to deep water ocean waves.  The restoring force is the
difference in magnetic field component projected along the wave
vector.  Like ocean waves, these waves penetrate about a wavelength
into each side.  We will be considering wavelengths of thousands of
AU, so the current sheet itself is neglible as far as the dynamics of
the waves are concerned.  Seen in projection along the aligned sheet,
the projected wavelengths will be $\sim $ AU.  The displacements are
transverse to the wave vector, and perpendicular to the sheet.  While
alvenic in nature, the surface modes possess only one polarization,
unlike bulk waves.  These waves resemble a flag blowing in the wind.
Disturbances travelling along the sheet are decoupled from bulk waves.
Being confined to a sheet, the amplitude away from a source drops as
$\propto 1/r$ instead of the normal inverse square law.  A amplitude
of order $\alpha \lambda$, or about $10^{-3}$ of the wavelength is
sufficient to cause the sheet to appear folded in projection.

\section{Fold Statistics}

Alven waves dissipate on scales shorter than the proton mean free
path.  We thus model the waves as a displacement function $\zeta(x)$
which is a Gaussian random field with a correlation function that is a
Gaussian, $\xi(r)=\langle \zeta(x)
\zeta(x+r)\rangle=\exp(-r^2/2/\sigma^2)$, where $\sigma$ is the
dissipation scale.  Figure \ref{fig:sheet} shows a realization of a
sheet with a random fluctuations.

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\epsfig{file=sheet.eps,width=3in}}
\caption{Sheet with transverse perturbations.  The upper panel shows
  an zoomed version of a short section.}
\label{fig:sheet}
\end{figure}

In projection, the surface density results in a highly non-Gaussian
distribution. Figure \ref{fig:rho} shows the density distribution in a
simulation.  Folds occur when the gradient of the displacement is
equal to minus 1.  The correlation function of the gradients is the
second derivative of the displacements.  The number of crossings of -1
depends on the variance of the gradient field.  The density of the
folded sheet is proportionate to the length of gradient spent in the
vicinity of -1, which is turn is proportionate to the reciprocal of
the derivative of the gradient.  This second derivative is also a
Gaussian random field.  The second derivative is uncorrelated with the
first derivative.  The one point PDF of the reciprocal of a Gaussian
variable is
\beq
P(\rho)=\frac{\exp(-\frac{1}{2 \rho^2})}{\sqrt{2\pi}\rho^2}.
\eeq
This is a highly non-Gaussian distribution, and resembles.  The very
high tails are 
cut off by higher order derivatives of the correlation function.

\begin{figure}

\caption{projected density}
\label{fig:rho}
\end{figure}

These high density caustics give rise to refractive lensing processes
which resemble the inverted parabolic arcs in pulsar secondary
spectra.

\section{Lensing}

The lensing of this density sheet can be computed in analogy to 
\cite{2012MNRAS.421L.132P}.

\label{fig:dt}
\end{figure}

\section{Simulated Dynamic Spectra}

With the density field, we can solve the lens equations to simulate
dynamic spectra.

  axis is frequency.  We reproduce the characteristic criss-cross
  pattern observed in real scintillation spectra.}

\end{figure}

\section{Discussion}

We can estimate the length scales involved.  This theory requires as
input a current sheet thickness, inclination angle, curvature,
amplitude of waves, and dissipation scale.

The thickness of the sheets is determined by the magnification of
images: the flux is roughly the thickness divided by the impact
parameter.  It suggests a typical tickness of $h\sim 0.1$ AU.  A wave
of projected wavelength $\alpha \lambda$ enhances projected densities
by a factor $w=\sqrt{h \alpha \lambda}$.  The projected wavelengths
are known to be of order $\sim 10$ AU, so $w \sim 10$.  The largest
deflection angles are $\gamma \sim 0.1$ mas, which requires a
projected electron density change $\delta n_e/(w\alpha) \sim$.  In an
underdense sheet, the maximal change of density is the density itself.
For the mean interstellar medium densities determined from pulsar
dispersion, we obtain $\alpha \sim 10^{-2}$.  The probability of
seeing a sheet at such an angle is $\sim \alpha^2$, requiring the
existence of $\sim 1/\alpha^2$ sheets along the line of sight.  For
B0834+06, the distance is $\sim 1$ kpc, giving a typical sheet
separation of $s \sim 0.1$ pc.  If we assume the curvature to be
separation (it could be smaller), we find a limiting projection angle
$\alpha_{\rm min} = \sqrt{h/s} \sim 0.002$.  The wave amplitudes must
be $> \alpha \lambda$ in order to form projected caustics.  This is a
small amplitude, which rules out large amplitude universal turbulence.
The latter would deform the sheet too much.  In a Kolmogorov spectrum,
the energy power spectrum scales as $k^{-5/3}$.  Scaling from the
alven damping scale to the fresnel scale, this results in density
fluctuations $< 10^{-4}$.  This is insufficient to create
scintillation in pulsar fluxes.

These estimates are qualitative.  One expects current sheets to come
in a range of sizes, curvature and perturbation amplitude.  The
thickness might also vary, unless due to global resistivity.

\section{Conclusions}

We have presented a quantitative theory of pulsar scintillation
inverse parabolic arcs.  These extend recent ideas of thin current
sheets, which naturally explain the large angle scattering observed in
pulsars and some extragalactic sources.

This picture could explain all scintillation phenomena with structures
greater than 0.1 AU.  The apparent diffractive structure results from
the interference between refractive images, and no diffractive
scattering is needed.
