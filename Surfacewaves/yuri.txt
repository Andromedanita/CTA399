Hi Yuri,

I went through the paper, and tried to address each of your comments.

I also revised several of the figure, so Figure 2 now has the dashed lines
which makes the zoom more obvious, and I inverted the black-to-white in 
figures 9 and 10.

In terms of scientific content, I added discussion after (1), that
the sheets can be either under- or over-dense (citing Pen and King), 
which is used at several points in the text.

I am enclosing the .tex file and .pdf.  Can you take another read through it,
and see if it is coherent?

cheers,

Ue-Li
