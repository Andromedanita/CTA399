    Parameters
    ----------
    file1, file2 : string
        names of the two files holding (digital) filterbank voltage timeseries
    samplerate : float
        rate at which samples were originally taken
    fbottom, fband : float
        lower end and width of the frequency band
    nblock : int
        number of frequency channels (equals half the number of samples used
        in the FFT to construct the spectrum)
    nt, ntint : int
        total number nt of sets, each containing ntint samples in each file
        hence, total # of samples is nt*(2*ntint)
    nhead : int
        number of bytes to skip before reading
    ngate, ntbin : int
        number of phase and time bins to use for folded spectrum
        ntbin should be an integer fraction of nt
    ntw : int
        number of time samples to combine for waterfall (does not have to be
        integer fraction of nt)
    dm : float
        dispersion measure of pulsar, used to correct for ism delay
    phasepol : callable
        function that returns the pulsar phase for time in seconds relative to
        start of part of the file that is read (i.e., ignoring nhead)
    do_waterfall, do_foldspec : bool
        whether to construct waterfall, folded spectrum (default: True)
    verbose : bool
        whether to give some progress information (default: True)
